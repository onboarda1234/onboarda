# Onboarda / RegMind — Audit-Remediation Master List

**Last reconciled:** 2026-07-07 late (base `main` = `0edee4d`, HEAD after #700 merged —
SW-1 is now ✅; SW-2 #701 and SW-4 #703 remain the open CI-green PRs). **Audit 4 (FEO)
folded as Phase 13**; consolidated 4-audit verdict: BLOCKED for uncontrolled production,
conditional for controlled pilot; only remaining CRITICALs = DCI-001 (P12-1) and
DCI-027 (P9-8). P11-1 (BSA-001/014) implementation is in progress on branch
`claude/lucid-carson-ww52p3-p11-1`.
**Phase 10 Wave-1 complete:** all three current-stage blocking CRITICALs are merged,
deployed to AWS staging (`regmind-staging:782` / worker `:230`, image `e66405a`), and
validated (PASS) — **P10-1 #697 (RDI-006), P10-3 #696 (RDI-004), P10-2 #698
(RDI-001/007/011)**; merge order #695 → #697 → #696 → #698. Audits 2 (BSA) and 3 (DCI)
have since RUN — folded below as Phases 11 and 12. **#704 merged** (Codex): maker-checker
narrowed to Tier 1 only — closes the approved four-eyes scope change that #697 had left
outstanding. **#702 (SW-3) merged**: staging-SHA alignment gate now enforced in the deploy
workflow. Small-wins **#700 (SW-1) · #701 (SW-2) · #703 (SW-4)** remain open, CI-green,
awaiting review + Codex handover. Prior batches all merged/validated: #692/#690/#693/#691
(TDs 775/776/777), #687/#688/#689 (TDs 771/772/773), docs #695. Incorporates
REGMIND-SYSTEM-READINESS-AUDIT-1 (P9-12/13/14 + CLIENT-PORTAL-RUNTIME-SMOKE-1 +
PERIODIC-BASELINE-METHOD-HYGIENE-1), an Optional/Post-Production Modernization section,
Phase 10 (RDI audit), **Phase 11 (BSA audit / Audit 2 — 19 findings)**, and **Phase 12
(DCI audit / Audit 3 — 30 findings, 6 blockers, schema safety rated UNSAFE)**. Section
order now places **Phase 9 (Production readiness) last**, after Phases 10/11/12.
**PR #699** (Codex draft, P10-1 closure-evidence docs) was **closed unmerged** — its closure
record is carried here instead.

| # | PR | Findings | Severity | What it fixes (plain) | GitHub | Status |
|---|----|----------|:--:|-----------------------|:--:|:--:|
| P10-1 | PR-RDI-1 — Server-side materiality | RDI-006 | CRITICAL | Ignore client-supplied change materiality; always classify server-side from change type via `classify_materiality(change_type)` | [#697](https://github.com/onboarda1234/onboarda/pull/697) | ✅ merged |
| P10-2 | PR-RDI-2 — Fail-closed decision & memo persistence | RDI-001, 007, 011 | CRITICAL + HIGH + MED | Decision status+audit+signoff+decision_record in one transaction; memo approve/validate roll back and 500 on save failure (no false "success") | [#698](https://github.com/onboarda1234/onboarda/pull/698) | ✅ merged |
| P10-3 | PR-RDI-3 — Risk-staleness gate | RDI-004 | CRITICAL | Block final decisions when `risk_config_version` ≠ current or recompute failed; persist recompute failures | [#696](https://github.com/onboarda1234/onboarda/pull/696) | ✅ merged |
| P10-4 | PR-RDI-4 — Per-decision-type gates | RDI-003, 008 | HIGH | Add required prerequisites for reject / escalate_edd / request_documents; block failed-validation memo from supervisor step **(needs policy decision on per-type prerequisites)** | — | 📋 scoped (decision-gated) |
| P10-5 | PR-RDI-5 — Decision-record coverage + provenance | RDI-009 (non-SAR), 010 | HIGH | Write decision_records for EDD closure / monitoring actions / change approvals / risk changes; add AI-vs-rule source + `agent_executions` link. Depends on **P10-2** | — | 📋 scoped |
| P10-6 | PR-RDI-6 — Sign-off IP attribution | RDI-012 | HIGH | Trust `X-Real-IP` only when the direct peer is a known proxy/ALB (stop browser spoofing) | — | 📋 scoped |
| P10-7 | PR-RDI-7 — Append-only audit at DB level | RDI-013 (non-SAR) | MEDIUM | Separate migration/admin DB role from runtime role; revoke runtime `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `audit_log`/`decision_records`/`supervisor_audit_log`; stop cleanup code deleting those rows *(code half ships early; grants half is RDS/infra)* | — | 📋 scoped (part ops) |

**Deferred (per management response 2026-07-07):**
- **RDI-002** — by-design LOW/MEDIUM fast-path, HIGH policy-exception (not a code defect). **P10-DOC-1:** policy **✅ APPROVED & signed off** (Aisha Sudally, 2026-07-07) at [`docs/compliance/LOW_MEDIUM_FASTPATH_APPROVAL_POLICY.md`](compliance/LOW_MEDIUM_FASTPATH_APPROVAL_POLICY.md) (eligibility = all LOW/MEDIUM; disqualifiers = sanctioned/FATF, PEP, adverse hit, stale/incomplete screening, failed IDV; approver = Onboarding Officer alone; 20% QA sampling). **Residual code assertions** (decision-record eligibility-basis stamp + direct-route test that a disqualifying signal can never fast-track) folded into the Phase 10 approval-path PRs (P10-3 / P10-5) — ⬜.
- **RDI-005** — SAR permanence (`ON DELETE CASCADE`, cleanup delete, mutable SAR content), HIGH **Enterprise pre-enable blocker**. Must be fixed **before** enabling Enterprise SAR/STR; safe to defer **only while SAR/STR feature flags stay disabled** (`ENABLE_SAR_WORKFLOW`, `ENABLE_SAR_STR` = false). Same guard covers the SAR slices of RDI-009/RDI-013. *(Re-confirmed by Audit-3 **DCI-002** — same cascade + pre-file overwrite findings; note the general SAR cleanup-delete surface is also covered by P12-1.)*

**Wave order:** W1 P10-1 → P10-2 → P10-3 (all CRITICAL; P10-2 unblocks P10-5) · W2 P10-4, P10-5, P10-6 (HIGH) · W3 P10-7 (MED/infra). P10-1 and P10-6 are small quick wins slot-able anytime.

**Closure evidence (2026-07-07):**
- **P10-1 (#697)** — **merged** (base `b577a5f`, merge `b6192fb`; ancestor of deployed HEAD `e66405a`, so live on `regmind-staging:782`). `create_change_request()` now ignores client-supplied `items[].materiality` and server-computes tier from `change_type` via `classify_materiality`; fresh-context review fold prevents server-known alert types (e.g. `control_change`) downgrading to `other`/Tier 2. Full SQLite suite 6549 passed; CM regression 217 passed; static guard asserts no `item.get("materiality")` read. **RDI-006 CLOSED/REMEDIATED** (Codex-verified; control C-11 VERIFIED for client-supplied override). **Two residuals:** (a) `change_type` itself is still client-supplied — semantic mislabeling is a future hardening item (unknown types default Tier 2); (b) the previously-approved four-eyes scope change (tier1,tier2→tier1) was not part of #697 — **since CLOSED by #704** (Codex, merge `956ed5b`): maker-checker narrowed to Tier 1 only, Tier 2 still covered by the screening hard-block.
- **P10-3 (#696)** — **merged**, deployed (`regmind-staging:781` / `regmind-verification-worker:229`, image `fbedc7c`), validated. Targeted `test_risk_staleness_gate.py` 15 passed; runtime synthetic probe confirmed current-version app proceeds, older-version app + `stale:recompute_failed` quarantine both 409-block, non-approval decisions (reject/escalate/request-docs = 201) not newly blocked. **RDI-004 CLOSED/PASS.** Residual (per design): legacy `NULL`-provenance apps blocked only after first config update/sweep.
- **P10-2 (#698)** — rebased onto #696-merged `main`, retargeted, CI green, **merged**, deployed (`regmind-staging:782` / `regmind-verification-worker:230`, image `e66405a`), validated. Targeted decision/memo/approval suite 263 passed / 2 skipped; full SQLite suite 6568 passed. Runtime probe: decision 201 persisted `decision_records_count=1` + audit + accepted governance; memo approve 200 with signoff audit; memo validate 200 persisted status+timestamp. **RDI-001 / RDI-007 / RDI-011 CLOSED/PASS.** Residual: live-DB fault injection not run (forced-failure covered by merged tests); memo-supervisor `decision_records` overlay stays scoped to P10-5/RDI-009.
- Final staging aligned to #698 merge SHA `e66405a`; `/api/version` git_sha+image_tag match; liveness/health/readiness 200 (`ready=true`); both ALB targets healthy; 30-min CloudWatch window ERROR/Exception/Traceback/HTTP-5 = 0.

**Audit-2 unpause status:** ✅ **all three current-stage blocking CRITICALs closed & validated** — RDI-006 (#697), RDI-004 (#696), RDI-001 (#698). Merge order on `main`: #695 → #697 → #696 → #698 (HEAD `e66405a`, deployed `regmind-staging:782`). The audit artifact's "remaining blockers RDI-001/RDI-004" note reflects the point-in-time when #697 was verified — both have since merged. **Audit 2 has since run** (see Phase 11). Remaining Phase 10 work is W2/W3 (HIGH/MED: P10-4 decision-gated, P10-5 dep-on-P10-2, P10-6, P10-7) plus the deferred RDI-002/005 items; the four-eyes scope decision is closed (#704, Tier-1-only maker-checker).

## Phase 11 — Backend Security & Authorization (BSA audit)
> Source: **RegMind Production Audit 2 — Backend Security & Authorization**, run against
> `e66405a` (PR #698 merge — post-Audit-1-closure). 19 findings (BSA-001…019).
> **Verdict: REMEDIATE BEFORE PROCEEDING** — 2 HIGH blockers (BSA-001, BSA-015); rest MED/LOW.
> **BSA-002 is not new** — it is Phase 4 item 26 (Shared rate limiter), cross-referenced there.
> Audit positively verified several controls (12-char password policy, CSRF double-submit,
> Sumsub HMAC-before-parse constant-time, mock-mode prod hard-block, no-wildcard CORS in prod,
> security headers). Many sections UNVERIFIED (not exhaustively checked; deepest gap = the
> P9-13 route×role matrix, already listed). 18 net-new findings grouped into 9 PRs, 3 waves.
> Item IDs `P11-1…P11-9` canonical. Same discipline per PR: implement → full SQLite + live-PG
> tests → fresh-context adversarial review → fold → push.

## Phase 13 — Frontend & Operational Readiness (FEO audit)
> Source: **RegMind Production Audit 4 — Frontend & Operational Readiness**, run against
> `57890e3` (#702 merge). 15 findings (FEO-001…015). Consolidated 4-audit verdict:
> **BLOCKED** for uncontrolled production; **conditional for controlled pilot** with
> documented manual controls. The only remaining CRITICALs across all 4 audits are
> **DCI-001** (= P12-1) and **DCI-027** (= P9-8) — both already tracked.
> Positives verified: token in httpOnly cookie / in-memory only (no localStorage);
> portal password fields + 12-char policy mirror; prescreening inputs are allowlisted
> selects; client cannot set status; portal renderers use `escapeHtml()` far more
> consistently than backoffice.
> **8 of 15 findings are already tracked elsewhere** — cross-referenced, NOT duplicated:
> FEO-008 = P9-4/P9-5 (prod provisioning + deploy/rollback drill) · FEO-009 = DCI-027 =
> P9-8 · FEO-010 = P9-7 (secrets-rotation half) · FEO-011 = P9-10 (+ DCI-030) ·
> FEO-012 = P9-2 (PC-1 evidence-pack continuity residual + supervisor-export hash
> stripping) · FEO-013 = PR-APP-ACTION-OWNERSHIP-SCOPE-1 (Phase 7) · FEO-015 = Optional
> Modernization §2 (frontend rework/profiling).
> The 7 net-new findings group into 6 PRs + 1 ops/docs pack. Item IDs `P13-1…P13-7`
> canonical. Frontend PRs touch `arie-backoffice.html` / `arie-portal.html` only.

| # | PR | Findings | Severity | What it fixes (plain) | GitHub | Status |
|---|----|----------|:--:|-----------------------|:--:|:--:|
| P13-1 | Backoffice stored-XSS elimination | FEO-001, 002 | HIGH | Escape (or DOM-construct with `textContent`) every API-interpolated field in the memo renderer (`renderMemoSections`) and supervisor/audit renderers (contradictions, rules, audit entries, chain errors); fixed enum→class maps for status/risk badges; XSS regression fixtures (payload in company name, memo section, red flag, supervisor recommendation, audit detail, error string) | — | 📋 scoped (W1) |
| P13-2 | Single API wrapper + consistent CSRF | FEO-003 | MED | Route all 23 backoffice + portal raw `fetch()` sites through `boApiCall`/`apiCall`; state-changing calls fail closed client-side without a CSRF token; consistent `credentials: 'include'` (incl. logout + uploads + supervisor-run) | — | 📋 scoped |
| P13-3 | Defensive API response parsing | FEO-004 | MED | Check status + `Content-Type` BEFORE `res.json()` in both wrappers; handle 401 before JSON-dependent logic; text/error-envelope fallback for ALB/proxy HTML errors | — | 📋 scoped |
| P13-4 | App-detail render race guard | FEO-005 | MED | Monotonic request nonce / expected-ref check in `openAppDetail`→`renderAuthoritativeAppDetail`; ignore stale responses so Application A can never render over Application B's context | — | 📋 scoped |
| P13-5 | Role-UI fail-closed until matrix loads | FEO-006 | LOW | Privileged controls hidden/disabled with a loading/retry state until the RBAC matrix is fetched (today UI deliberately fails open; backend remains the gate) | — | 📋 scoped |
| P13-6 | Portal intake PII out of sessionStorage | FEO-007 | MED | Persist company-intake state via the authenticated server-side save/resume path; keep only an opaque resume handle client-side; clear legacy `arie_company_intake_state` on load | — | 📋 scoped |
| P13-7 | Compliance-officer SOP pack | FEO-014 | MED (ops/docs) | Officer onboarding/training SOP, pre-approval review checklist, `INCONSISTENT` supervisor-verdict handling, senior escalation, override + evidence-export procedures | — | 📋 scoped (ops/docs) |

**Wave order:** W1 P13-1 (the two HIGH stored-XSS findings — officer-session code execution) · W2 P13-2…P13-6 · P13-7 alongside (docs, non-code).

## Optional / Post-Production Modernization (NOT required for pilot or first production cut)

> These are **elective** architecture/scale/enterprise upgrades to consider
> *after* production launch. They are tracked separately from the remediation
> roll-up. Risk column = impact of the change itself on running workflows:
> 🟢 additive/safe · 🟡 modifies live path (guardable by flag/parallel-run/test) ·
> 🔴 modifies live path (intrinsic — cannot be made fully additive).
> **Cleared?** column: ✅ already done · 🟡 partially done · 🟢 already on the
> remediation list above · — not started.

### 4. SQLite / PostgreSQL dual support
| # | Step | Impl. risk | Cleared? |
|---|------|:--:|:--:|
| 4.1 | Run migrations against real PostgreSQL in CI | 🟢 | ✅ **done** — CI creates a fresh PG DB and runs the full suite (`ci.yml`) |
| 4.2 | Migration round-trip / idempotency tests | 🟢 | ✅ **largely done** — `tests/test_migration_*` (004–026 idempotency, chain, backfill-replay) |
| 4.3 | Make SQLite dev-only (decision + docs) | 🟡 | — |

|---|------|:--:|:--:|
| 5b.1 | RDS Multi-AZ + backups + PITR | 🟡 | ✅ done on **staging** (audit: Multi-AZ, deletion protection, 7-day retention); prod RDS not yet provisioned |

**Open PRs:** Wave-A small-wins **#700 (SW-1) · #701 (SW-2) · #703 (SW-4)** — CI-green,
do-not-merge, awaiting review + Codex handover · **Old blocked draft:** #498.
**Recently merged:** #702 (SW-3, staging-SHA gate) · #704 (Tier-1-only maker-checker) ·
Phase 10 Wave 1 #696/#697/#698 (deployed + validated PASS) · docs #695 · #699 closed
unmerged (redundant). Earlier code PRs (#687–#693) merged/validated.

**Where things stand:** Phases 0–3 (except B7 #12) and 5–6 done. **Phase 4 fully
built/merged** (only decision-gated #17/#21/#24/#26/#28 remain). Phase 7: status-canon
done + audit-tamper (#691) merged; ownership gate not started (⬜). Phases 8–9 are the
remaining body — overwhelmingly ops/vendor/legal, not code. **Phase 10 (RDI audit):**
**all three current-stage CRITICALs closed & validated — P10-1 (#697, RDI-006) · P10-3
(#696, RDI-004) · P10-2 (#698, RDI-001/007/011)**; P10-DOC-1 policy approved; W2/W3
(P10-4…P10-7, HIGH/MED) and the deferred RDI-002/005 items remain. **Phase 11 (BSA audit,
Audit 2 — run against `e66405a`):** 19 findings folded as P11-1…P11-9; 2 HIGH blockers
(BSA-001 revocation fail-open, BSA-015 dependency CVEs) lead Wave 1; BSA-002 = existing
item 26. **Phase 12 (DCI audit, Audit 3 — run against `956ed5b`):** 30 findings; 11 map to
existing items (incl. 3 blockers elevating item 21 / P9-1 / P9-8), 19 net-new folded as
P12-1…P12-10; code blockers P12-1 (regulated-record deletion) + P12-2 (change-implementation
recompute) lead Wave 1. **Section order:** phase sections now run …8 → 10 → 11 → 12 →
**9 (Production readiness, last)**. Pilot-readiness ≈ 88–92%; production-readiness ≈ 30–35%
(Audit 3 verdict: REMEDIATE BEFORE PROCEEDING).
