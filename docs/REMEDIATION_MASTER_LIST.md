# Onboarda / RegMind — Audit-Remediation Master List

**Last reconciled:** 2026-07-11 (base `main` = `6ba253d`; P12-1 #738 merged + AWS-staging-validated for controlled pilot; DCI-006 staging remediation executed (#739, Codex PASS); full-consolidated audit RE-RUN folded — see [**Re-audit 2026-07-11**](#re-audit-2026-07-11-d23cc45--reconciliation) section below; prior reconcile 2026-07-10 on `84de284` after #735, staging validated `8a0fdef`/`0e1a4ee`).
**2026-07-09/11 batch — 4 of the 4 controlled-pilot CODE blockers CLOSED (merged + AWS-staging-validated):**
**#729 (P13-1, back-office stored-XSS)** PASS-with-limitation · **#728 (item 26 / BSA-002, shared fail-closed rate limiter)** PASS-with-limitation (migration v2.51 `shared_rate_limits`) · **#730 (P11-2, dep-CVE + pip-audit CI gate)** PASS-with-limitation · **#738 (P12-1, regulated-record deletion protection)** PASS for controlled-pilot closure (staging SHA/image `6ba253d49d786cd686b5d53cba80b649ff7d35cf`; backend TD `regmind-staging:827`; worker TD `regmind-verification-worker:275`; authenticated `/api/version` + `/api/readiness` 200; synthetic P12-1 app/document delete guards, fixture cleanup guard, retention purge, and v2.13 report-only boot checks passed). Also landed: **#731→#732** (Applications audit-log isolation by immutable `application_id`, migration v2.50; APP-727-001/002 CLOSED), **#733** (P9-13 role×route matrix harness), **#734** (clean-approval e2e, APP-AUD-003), **#735** (APP-AUD-001 role-UI/authz alignment). Migration sequence v2.47…v2.51 clean, no collision, no up-front-index (#717-class) bug. Staging == latest `origin/main`; the known v2.47 DCI-006 off-canon logs are **RESOLVED** — remediation SQL merged (#739, `9d597ea`) and **executed on staging 2026-07-11 (Codex PASS)**: all 3 v2.47 CHECK constraints (`clients_status_check`, `agent_executions_status_check`, `agent_executions_source_check`) now installed, off-canon counts 0, DCI-006 CloudWatch ERRORs cleared (54 unindexed FKs remain a separate open follow-up; staging remediation only — no production-readiness claim). **2026-07-11 audit re-run** additionally surfaced net-new HIGH findings (risk-parser under-scoring DCI-108/109; supervisor-route/CSRF cluster BSA-001–004 re-run) + 4 confirmed partials — see the [Re-audit 2026-07-11](#re-audit-2026-07-11-d23cc45--reconciliation) section.
**Wave A fully closed:** all four small-wins merged + deployed to AWS staging + validated
(PASS) — **#700 (SW-1)**, **#701 (SW-2, `dd28a79`, TD 788)**, **#702 (SW-3, staging-SHA
gate)**, **#703 (SW-4, `daab2bb`, TD 789)**; staging == `origin/main` == `daab2bb`.
**Overnight batch — merged + DEPLOYED to AWS staging + validated (Codex closure report):**
**#705 (P11-1)** PASS, **#706 (P11-3)** PASS-with-limitation (budget-store outage source/test-validated,
not live fault-injected), **#708 (P10-6)** PASS-with-limitation (no live sign-off audit record;
spoof rejection source/test-validated), **#707 (P11-9)** PASS. Final staging SHA `fadf8a6` ==
latest `origin/main`; backend `regmind-staging:796`, worker `regmind-verification-worker:244`;
`/api/version`+liveness+health+readiness 200; CloudWatch ERROR/Exception/Traceback/5xx = 0.
Staging-only evidence — no production-readiness claim. **Wave B built
(do-not-merge):** **#709 (P12-6 / DCI-007)**, **#710 (P12-3 / DCI-008+010+011)** — each
implemented → SQLite + live-PostgreSQL → fresh-context adversarial review → folded → pushed.
**Audit 4 (FEO) folded as Phase 12.** Consolidated 4-audit verdict: BLOCKED for
uncontrolled production, conditional for controlled pilot; P12-1 / DCI-001 is
closed for controlled pilot by #738, while DCI-027 (P9-8) remains tracked.
**Phase 9 (RDI) Wave-1 complete:** the three current-stage blocking CRITICALs are merged,
deployed (`regmind-staging:782` / worker `:230`, image `e66405a`), validated (PASS) —
**P10-1 #697 (RDI-006), P10-3 #696 (RDI-004), P10-2 #698 (RDI-001/007/011)**; merge order
#695 → #697 → #696 → #698. **#704 merged** (Codex): maker-checker narrowed to Tier 1 only
— closes the approved four-eyes scope change #697 had left outstanding. Prior batches all
merged/validated: #692/#690/#693/#691 (TDs 775/776/777), #687/#688/#689 (TDs 771/772/773),
docs #695. Incorporates REGMIND-SYSTEM-READINESS-AUDIT-1 (P9-12/13/14 +
CLIENT-PORTAL-RUNTIME-SMOKE-1 + PERIODIC-BASELINE-METHOD-HYGIENE-1), an Optional/
Post-Production Modernization section, Phase 9 (RDI audit), **Phase 10 (BSA / Audit 2 —
19 findings)**, **Phase 11 (DCI / Audit 3 — 30 findings, 6 blockers, schema UNSAFE)**, and
**Phase 12 (FEO / Audit 4 — 15 findings)**. Section order places **Phase 14 (Production
readiness) last**, after Phases 8–13 (sections renumbered per founder instruction
2026-07-08; Phase 8 is now the Monitoring alerts stream, Phase 13 the Pilot Controls Pack). **PR #699** (Codex draft, P10-1
closure-evidence docs) was **closed unmerged** — its closure record is carried here.

> Maintenance: this is the single source of truth for remediation status. On any
> request for PR/phase status, refresh the Status/GitHub columns from GitHub and
> update this file. Item IDs (1–40, 33–38, M-series, P9-1…P9-14, P10-1…P10-7, P11-1…P11-9, P12-1…P12-10, P13-1…P13-7, PR-* slugs) are canonical and NEVER renumbered — their numeric prefixes reflect the section numbering in force when each audit landed and are retained for continuity with merged PRs, audit reports, and closure evidence. Section headings were renumbered on 2026-07-08 (founder instruction), so item-ID prefixes intentionally do NOT match today's section numbers (e.g. P10-x items live in Phase 9 — RDI; P9-x items live in Phase 14 — Production readiness).

P13-1 may alternatively be *formally accepted with compensating controls* rather than fully closed.

**Deferred (per management response 2026-07-07):**
- **RDI-002** — by-design LOW/MEDIUM fast-path, HIGH policy-exception (not a code defect). **P10-DOC-1:** policy **✅ APPROVED & signed off** (Aisha Sudally, 2026-07-07) at [`docs/compliance/LOW_MEDIUM_FASTPATH_APPROVAL_POLICY.md`](compliance/LOW_MEDIUM_FASTPATH_APPROVAL_POLICY.md) (eligibility = all LOW/MEDIUM; disqualifiers = sanctioned/FATF, PEP, adverse hit, stale/incomplete screening, failed IDV; approver = Onboarding Officer alone; 20% QA sampling). **Residual code assertions** (decision-record eligibility-basis stamp + direct-route test that a disqualifying signal can never fast-track) folded into the RDI (Phase 9) approval-path PRs (P10-3 / P10-5) — ⬜.
- **RDI-005** — SAR permanence (`ON DELETE CASCADE`, cleanup delete, mutable SAR content), HIGH **Enterprise pre-enable blocker**. Must be fixed **before** enabling Enterprise SAR/STR; safe to defer **only while SAR/STR feature flags stay disabled** (`ENABLE_SAR_WORKFLOW`, `ENABLE_SAR_STR` = false). Same guard covers the SAR slices of RDI-009/RDI-013. *(Re-confirmed by Audit-3 **DCI-002** — same cascade + pre-file overwrite findings; note the general SAR cleanup-delete surface is also covered by P12-1.)*

**Wave order:** W1 P10-1 → P10-2 → P10-3 (all CRITICAL; P10-2 unblocks P10-5) · W2 P10-4, P10-5, P10-6 (HIGH) · W3 P10-7 (MED/infra). P10-1 and P10-6 are small quick wins slot-able anytime.

**Closure evidence (2026-07-07):**
- **P10-1 (#697)** — **merged** (base `b577a5f`, merge `b6192fb`; ancestor of deployed HEAD `e66405a`, so live on `regmind-staging:782`). `create_change_request()` now ignores client-supplied `items[].materiality` and server-computes tier from `change_type` via `classify_materiality`; fresh-context review fold prevents server-known alert types (e.g. `control_change`) downgrading to `other`/Tier 2. Full SQLite suite 6549 passed; CM regression 217 passed; static guard asserts no `item.get("materiality")` read. **RDI-006 CLOSED/REMEDIATED** (Codex-verified; control C-11 VERIFIED for client-supplied override). **Two residuals:** (a) `change_type` itself is still client-supplied — semantic mislabeling is a future hardening item (unknown types default Tier 2); (b) the previously-approved four-eyes scope change (tier1,tier2→tier1) was not part of #697 — **since CLOSED by #704** (Codex, merge `956ed5b`): maker-checker narrowed to Tier 1 only, Tier 2 still covered by the screening hard-block.
- **P10-3 (#696)** — **merged**, deployed (`regmind-staging:781` / `regmind-verification-worker:229`, image `fbedc7c`), validated. Targeted `test_risk_staleness_gate.py` 15 passed; runtime synthetic probe confirmed current-version app proceeds, older-version app + `stale:recompute_failed` quarantine both 409-block, non-approval decisions (reject/escalate/request-docs = 201) not newly blocked. **RDI-004 CLOSED/PASS.** Residual (per design): legacy `NULL`-provenance apps blocked only after first config update/sweep.
- **P10-2 (#698)** — rebased onto #696-merged `main`, retargeted, CI green, **merged**, deployed (`regmind-staging:782` / `regmind-verification-worker:230`, image `e66405a`), validated. Targeted decision/memo/approval suite 263 passed / 2 skipped; full SQLite suite 6568 passed. Runtime probe: decision 201 persisted `decision_records_count=1` + audit + accepted governance; memo approve 200 with signoff audit; memo validate 200 persisted status+timestamp. **RDI-001 / RDI-007 / RDI-011 CLOSED/PASS.** Residual: live-DB fault injection not run (forced-failure covered by merged tests); memo-supervisor `decision_records` overlay stays scoped to P10-5/RDI-009.
- Final staging aligned to #698 merge SHA `e66405a`; `/api/version` git_sha+image_tag match; liveness/health/readiness 200 (`ready=true`); both ALB targets healthy; 30-min CloudWatch window ERROR/Exception/Traceback/HTTP-5 = 0.

**Audit-2 unpause status:** ✅ **all three current-stage blocking CRITICALs closed & validated** — RDI-006 (#697), RDI-004 (#696), RDI-001 (#698). Merge order on `main`: #695 → #697 → #696 → #698 (HEAD `e66405a`, deployed `regmind-staging:782`). The audit artifact's "remaining blockers RDI-001/RDI-004" note reflects the point-in-time when #697 was verified — both have since merged. **Audit 2 has since run** (see Phase 10 — BSA). Remaining RDI work is W2/W3 (HIGH/MED: P10-4 decision-gated, P10-5 dep-on-P10-2, P10-6, P10-7) plus the deferred RDI-002/005 items; the four-eyes scope decision is closed (#704, Tier-1-only maker-checker).

**Item 36 closure evidence (2026-07-12).** #748 introduced the registered
negative-path fixture substrate; #749 moved it to the reserved
`FX-ITEM36-*` namespace after the original ARF refs collided with long-lived
staging rows. Hotfix merge `6197734bc7a64ee83fba6e261625c8b6ec45a856`
was deployed through staging run `29204426827`. The complete synthetic
walkthrough passed: 12 logical fixtures / 13 application refs seeded, all refs
read back through the authenticated API, a second seed retained every root and
child ID/count, blocked approval returned 400, terminal replay returned 409,
cross-client access returned 403, and the representative P12-1 direct delete
was denied without mutation. Sanctioned cleanup left zero Item 36 residue, and
all 12 previously occupied ARF refs (including non-fixture application
`acf4ade81e694d31`) remained unchanged. Retention decision: **A — staging left
clean**. CloudWatch was clean of runtime/deploy/fixture errors; one corrected
read-only operator preflight query produced a wrapper `IndexError` and no
mutation, classified separately as validation-harness noise. This closes Item
36 for controlled-pilot scope only and is not a production-readiness claim.

## Re-audit 2026-07-11 (`d23cc45`) — reconciliation

> Source: **RegMind Production Audit — full consolidated re-run**, executed against
> `main` = `d23cc45` (after the 2026-07-09/10 batch). Read-only Codex re-verification
> CONFIRMED every finding below.
> **⚠️ ID-collision caveat:** this re-run renumbered findings into a **1xx-series**
> (RDI-101…, DCI-101…123, FEO-101…113) plus a fresh **BSA-001…021** set — these re-run
> IDs are **DISTINCT from the identically-numbered original findings** (e.g. re-run
> **BSA-001 ≠ original BSA-001**/revocation-fail-open, which is CLOSED via #705; re-run
> BSA-016/019 ≠ the original supply-chain BSA-016/019 in P11-8/#712). Findings are

**A. Net-new findings (read-only re-verify CONFIRMED):**

| Re-run ID | Sev | Finding (code evidence) | Status |
|-----------|:--:|-------------------------|:--:|
| 🔴 DCI-108 | HIGH | Risk parser **under-scores** "very complex" ownership structure → 3 at `rule_engine.py:1219-1273`; combined with DCI-109 can flip an application **MEDIUM→LOW** (risk understatement). Fix = exact-enum rewrite + recompute. **Pilot-relevant** | ⬜ scoped (fix PR offered) |
| 🔴 DCI-109 | HIGH | "non-regulated" resolves to 1 via **dict-ordering fall-through** at `rule_engine.py:1219-1273` (should score higher); same MEDIUM→LOW flip risk. **Pilot-relevant** | ⬜ scoped (same fix PR) |
| DCI-110 | MED | Middle-band turnover 500k–5m **OVER-scores** to 4 at `rule_engine.py:1219-1273`. *(Correction: the audit/my earlier note called this under-scoring — it is over-scoring; severity corrected HIGH→MED.)* | ⬜ scoped |
| ✅ BSA-001 (re-run) | HIGH | Supervisor routes subclass `tornado.web.RequestHandler` via `SupervisorBaseHandler` (`supervisor/api.py:200`; 14 handlers; registered in `get_supervisor_routes()` `~:646`). They **already do bespoke JWT/role auth** (`require_auth`), so the gap is missing CSRF/security-header/request-id/rate-limit middleware **+ a wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`** on authenticated APIs — consolidate onto `BaseHandler` (its `prepare()` `~:243` wires CSRF; app sets `xsrf_cookies=False`). | ✅ **CLOSED — #743** (staging-validated 2026-07-11, `5c255e8`; backend TD `regmind-staging:829`, worker `:277`): supervisor routes on `BaseHandler` (cookie-CSRF enforced via `prepare()`, Bearer path intact), wildcard CORS removed |
| ✅ BSA-002 (re-run) | HIGH | Supervisor actor is **client-forgeable**: `ReviewSubmitHandler` (`supervisor/api.py:372`) and `EscalationHandler` (`:438`) fetch `user = require_auth(...)` but then persist actor from **request-body** fields (`reviewer_id`/`reviewer_name`/`reviewer_role`; `escalated_by`/`escalated_by_role`). Server must derive the actor from the session, never the body. | ✅ **CLOSED — #743** (staging-validated `5c255e8`): `get_server_actor()` — forged body actor ignored, session actor+role persisted (probe stored role `sco`); conflicts logged |
| ✅ BSA-003 (re-run) | HIGH | Supervisor reviews/overrides/escalations persist via **raw `sqlite3`** in **`arie-backend/supervisor/human_review.py`** (`HumanReviewService`; `import sqlite3` `~:22`, `submit_review` `~:251`, `escalate_case` `~:378`); every write is guarded by `if self.db_path:` (silently skipped when unset) and `setup_supervisor(db_path)` always passes a SQLite path → on staging (PostgreSQL) records land on ephemeral container disk. Fail-closed PostgreSQL persistence required. **Pilot-relevant** (audit-record loss). | ✅ **CLOSED — #747** (staging-validated 2026-07-12, `f3754cd`; backend TD `regmind-staging:832`, worker `:280`; **migration v2.52**): the 3 tables (`supervisor_human_reviews`/`_overrides`/`_escalations`) now durable in main PostgreSQL (11 indexes, legacy ids→text, `/app/arie.db` absent, evidence in PG); mirrors the `supervisor/audit.py` `get_db()` pattern; actor server-derived; `request_id` via contextvar; fail-closed source/CI/rollback-validated (live DB-failure injection not run on staging); **all 3 tables P12-1-classified as regulated**. |
| ✅ BSA-004 (re-run) | HIGH | **General CSRF bypass**: `check_xsrf_cookie()` (`base_handler.py` `~:527`) does `if "/webhook" in self.request.uri: return` — a substring match on the full URI (query string included), so ANY path containing `/webhook` skips CSRF. Replace with an exact **`self.request.path`** allowlist of the only two real webhooks (`/api/kyc/webhook`, `/api/webhooks/complyadvantage`); also fix the sibling `_csrf_exempt_paths` `.uri` match. **Pilot-relevant**. | ✅ **CLOSED — #743** (staging-validated `5c255e8`): exact `.path` allowlist — substring `/webhook` and `?=/webhook` query both 403; both real webhooks still reach signature verification (401 on missing sig) |

> **Consolidation intent** (BSA-001–004): one PR = supervisor routes onto BaseHandler +
> server-derived actor + fail-closed PostgreSQL persistence + exact-path CSRF allowlist.
> 🔴 **pilot-relevant** for BSA-003/004.

**B. Merged items re-flagged PARTIAL (read-only re-verify CONFIRMED):**

| Re-run ID | Refines | Finding still open | Status |
|-----------|:--:|--------------------|:--:|
| BSA-016 (re-run) | item 26 / #728 shared limiter | AI-route limiter gaps: `/api/documents/{id}/verify` + **both** supervisor pipeline triggers are unlimited; enhanced-upload limiter still process-local | ⬜ partial |
| BSA-019 (re-run) | P11-8 / #712 supply-chain | No hash-pinned lockfile / `pip install --require-hashes`; deps pinned by version only | ⬜ partial |
| RDI-107 (re-run) | P10-6 / #708 IP attribution | Trusted-proxy check trusts ANY private/loopback peer — `base_handler.py:811-847` returns `ip.is_private or ip.is_loopback`; needs an explicit proxy-CIDR allowlist | ⬜ partial |
| DCI-104 (re-run) | P12-5 / #716 + DCI-006 | 3 v2.47 CHECK constraints were **ABSENT** on staging **+ 54 unindexed FKs**. *(Correction: the DCI-006 remediation SQL was NOT "on main" — it landed via **[#739](https://github.com/onboarda1234/onboarda/pull/739)**, MERGED `9d597ea`.)* | ✅ #739 merged + **STAGING EXECUTED 2026-07-11 (Codex PASS)** — all 3 constraints installed, off-canon counts 0, DCI-006 CloudWatch noise cleared; execution `id=1` resolved as a reviewed synthetic exception · ⬜ 54-FK-index follow-up (open) |

**Process-hygiene follow-up (from the DCI-006 remediation):** the DCI-006 off-canon
values (`direct_probe`/`staging_direct_probe`) were injected into a **regulated table**
(`agent_executions`) by a **direct staging-DB probe** during an earlier automated validation
sprint — bypassing the app and the P12-1 `DBConnection` interceptor (which is exactly why
they were off-canon and un-catchable in-process). ⬜ **New LOW follow-up:** staging QA/validation
must not write raw SQL into regulated tables; route probe writes through the app or an
explicitly-marked fixture path so the interceptor and provenance flags stay authoritative.

**Net effect on readiness:** the earlier "≈94–96% pilot-ready" estimate was **walked back** on
the re-run. Since then the **entire BSA-001–004 supervisor/security cluster is CLOSED** (#743 +
#747, both staging-validated) — including the two pilot-relevant items (BSA-003 audit-record loss,
BSA-004 general CSRF bypass). The remaining pilot-relevant re-run item is **DCI-108/109** (risk
understatement, can flip MEDIUM→LOW) — retriage pending founder decision; the risk-parser fix
(exact-enum rewrite + recompute) is offered as the next code PR. DCI-110 (MED, over-scoring),
BSA-016/019 and RDI-107 (partials), and DCI-104's 54 unindexed FKs remain open follow-ups.

## Optional / Post-Production Modernization (NOT required for pilot or first production cut)

> These are **elective** architecture/scale/enterprise upgrades to consider
> *after* production launch. They are tracked separately from the remediation
> roll-up. Risk column = impact of the change itself on running workflows:
> 🟢 additive/safe · 🟡 modifies live path (guardable by flag/parallel-run/test) ·
> 🔴 modifies live path (intrinsic — cannot be made fully additive).
> **Cleared?** column: ✅ already done · 🟡 partially done · 🟢 already on the
> remediation list above · — not started.

|---|------|:--:|:--:|
| 5b.1 | RDS Multi-AZ + backups + PITR | 🟡 | ✅ done on **staging** (audit: Multi-AZ, deletion protection, 7-day retention); prod RDS not yet provisioned |
| 5b.2 | DR runbook + restore drill | 🟢 | 🟢 on list — **P9-8** |
| 5b.3 | Deploy rollback automation + circuit breaker | 🔴 | 🟡 partial — rollback *runbook* done (PR-16 #678); automation/circuit-breaker pending |
| 5b.4 | Provision production env via IaC | 🔴 | 🟢 on list — **P9-4** |

### 5c. Enterprise identity & compliance
